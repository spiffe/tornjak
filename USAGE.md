# Usage

We support three container images currently:
- [Tornjak Backend](https://github.com/spiffe/tornjak/pkgs/container/tornjak-be): This image can be deployed as a sidecar with any SPIRE server. 
- [Tornjak Manager](https://github.com/spiffe/tornjak/pkgs/container/tornjak-manager): A container that runs this image exposes a port to register multiple Tornjak backends and forward typical commands to multiple Tornjak backends from one API. 
- [Tornjak Frontend](https://github.com/spiffe/tornjak/pkgs/container/tornjak-fe): This image is typically deployed after the Tornjak Backend or Manager are deployed, as it requires a URL to connect directly to the Tornjak backend API.  

NOTE: Previously, we had images placing the Tornjak backend and SPIRE server in the same container, but these were recently deprecated. Images other than those above are NOT currently supported. 

## Tornjak Backend

This is meant to be deployed where it can access a SPIRE server. To run, the container has three arguments:

| Flag                   | Description                                                 | Default | Arguments | Required |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:--------|:----------|:---------|
| `--config, -c`         | Config file path for SPIRE server                           |         | `<path>`  | true     |
| `--tornjak-config, -t` | Config file path for Tornjak (see our [configuration reference](./docs/config-tornjak-agent.md)) | | `<path>` | false |
| `--expandEnv`          | If included, expand environment variables in Tornjak config | False   |           | false    |

```
docker run -p 10000:10000 -d ghcr.io/spiffe/tornjak-be:latest -c <SPIRE CONFIG PATH> -t <TORNJAK CONFIG PATH> -expandEnv
```

The above command creates a container listening at http://localhost:10000 for Tornjak API calls. Note that the config files must be accessible from INSIDE the container. Also note, this expands the container's environment variables in the Tornjak config map. 

For more instructions on Tornjak config formatting, please see our [configuration reference](./docs/config-tornjak-agent.md).

## Tornjak Manager

The manager is meant to be deployed where it can access all Tornjak backends we want to manage. To run, the container has no arguments. An example is below:

```
docker run -p 50000:50000 -d ghcr.io/spiffe/tornjak-manager:latest
```

This creates a service listening on container port 50000, forwarded to localhost:50000 for Tornjak Manager API calls. 

## Tornjak Frontend

The frontend is meant to connect to either the Tornjak backend or the Tornjak manager. To run the container, we must set some environment variables:

| Variable                    | Description | Default | Argument | Required |
|:----------------------------|-------------|--|--|--|
| `REACT_APP_API_SERVER_URI`  | URI for the Tornjak backend or Manager to connect to |   | `http://localhost:10000` | true |
| `REACT_APP_TORNJAK_MANAGER` | Boolean for whether the connected server is a manager | false | `true` | false |
| `REACT_APP_AUTH_SERVER_URI` | URI for the Keycloak instance to obtain access tokens |  | `http://localhost:8080` | false |

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e REACT_APP_API_SERVER_URI='http://localhost:50000' -e REACT_APP_TORNJAK_MANAGER=true ghcr.io/spiffe/tornjak-fe:latest
```

The above command is an example of how to run the frontend. This creates a UI available at http://localhost:3000 forwarded from container port 3000. It is listening to a Tornjak manager component available at http://localhost:50000, and knows to run in manager mode with the `REACT_APP_TORNJAK_MANAGER` flag. 

## Further steps

It is recommended to try a full deployment of the Tornjak frontend, backend, and SPIRE Server in minikube. Please see our [tutorial document](./docs/tornjak-quickstart.md) for step-by-step instructions.
